/**
 * Utility methods to handle the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> request header.
 * <p>
 * The X-Forwarded-For header was first introduced by Squid as a means of
 * passing on the IP address of the client to the server. It has since been
 * widely adopted by other proxy servers and load balancers so it's pretty much
 * considered a standard even if it technically isn't. What you are supposed to
 * get as your header is this:
 * <p>
 * <code>X-Forwarded-For: clientIP, server1IP, server2IP, server3IP</code>
 * <p>
 * The client IP address should be first, followed by first proxy server,
 * followed by any other servers in a comma separated list. The final server
 * that passes the request on to you won't be in the list, a proxy server or
 * load balancer will only append the address of server it received the request
 * from if the X-Forwarded-For header was passed to it otherwise it just
 * constructs a new X-Forwarded-For with just the client address in it. The
 * address of the last server in the complete chain is simply the address of the
 * client making the request to your server. But as usual in the web world there
 * are no guarantees.
 * <p>
 * There are some important catches to consider before you proceed to use this
 * header to do anything interesting:
 * <p>
 * Most importantly, headers can be crafted by anyone, never trust a header
 * value unless you are certain that it can't be spoofed. I'd actually just
 * simplify that to just never trust a header value. So if you are going to use
 * it then don't use it for anything that has security implications. The client
 * IP address that you get from the first entry may not actually be the address
 * that you want. Most of the time the requests will probably come directly from
 * the browser of your visitor but what if they are behind a proxy server within
 * a private network themselves? The IP address you may end up with could be
 * something like 10.1.34.121 which is of no value because it only tells you
 * that they are sitting on a private network somewhere in the world.
 * <p>
 * Best Guess IP Address When using X-Forwarded-For, the assumption normally
 * made is that the first IP address in the list is the client address that you
 * can use to do interesting things with, like IP address geolocation (Ã  la
 * GeoIP). But what about private addresses? What about the casual browser at
 * McDonalds using their WiFi with a 10.x.x.x address or a company network with
 * a 192.168.x.x internal address structure? You'll end up with a very unhelpful
 * address that'll tell you nothing very interesting about the client.
 * <p>
 * If you have a client behind one of these networks and it's not routed through
 * a proxy server then you'll probably just get the IP address of the NAT
 * gateway which is likely to be the address you want to use. If the request is
 * routed through a proxy server then you may get an X-Forwarded-For that looks
 * something like this:
 * <p>
 * X-Forwarded-For: 10.208.4.38, 58.163.175.187
 * <p>
 * You may also have a chain of multiple servers, perhaps you have a downstream
 * proxy server going through a larger upstream one before heading out of the
 * network, so you may get something like this:
 * <p>
 * X-Forwarded-For: 10.208.4.38, 58.163.1.4, 58.163.175.187
 * <p>
 * Or, the downstream proxy server could be within the private network, perhaps
 * a departmental proxy server connecting to a company-wide proxy server and
 * then this may happen:
 * <p>
 * X-Forwarded-For: 10.208.4.38, 10.10.300.23, 58.163.175.187
 * <p>
 * This could of course be even more complex as you may have a longer chain of
 * proxy servers (although I've never actually seen anyone chain more than 2
 * layers of proxy servers together in a network before).
 * <p>
 * The rule that I suggest is <strong><em>Always use the leftmost non-private
 * address.</em></strong>.
